    "# Non-Ergodic Dynamics in Multiplicative Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In many stochastic systems, growth occurs multiplicatively rather than additively.\n",
    "Such systems exhibit fundamentally different long-term behavior, where ensemble averages\n",
    "diverge from time-averaged outcomes experienced by individual trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook investigates the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why do most trajectories in multiplicative systems lose value over time,\n",
    "> despite the existence of rare paths with extremely high returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Monte Carlo simulation and binomial (CRR) trees, we demonstrate that:\n",
    "1. Log-growth, not expected value, governs long-term outcomes.\n",
    "2. Increased volatility amplifies the divergence between mean and median wealth.\n",
    "3. Value in option pricing is dominated by rare, extreme states rather than typical outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis proceeds in three stages: simulation of wealth processes,\n",
    "analytical examination of log-growth, and state-space analysis via binomial trees.\n",
