## Non-Ergodic Dynamics in Multiplicative Systems

This lab investigates the long-term behavior of multiplicative stochastic processes
using Monte Carlo simulation and binomial (CRR) trees.

We demonstrate that positive expected value does not imply positive long-term growth,
due to volatility drag and non-ergodicity. In particular, we show how a small number of
extreme outcomes dominate ensemble averages while the typical trajectory declines over time.

The analysis connects wealth dynamics with option pricing to illustrate why volatility
is harmful to individual growth but valuable in derivative pricing.
